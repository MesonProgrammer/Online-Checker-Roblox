# Online Checker Roblox
 Checks if a user is online on Roblox and notifies you when they are.

## Introduction
Ever wanted to see if someone is online or playing on Roblox but are too lazy to go to their Roblox page? This program is exactly built for that situation! No longer do you have to tediously go on the Roblox website and search the person's username up. With this program, you automatically get notified if that person is online! It doesn't even have to be a singular person, it can be a group of people!

## How to use Online Checker (for dummies)
This will be a step-by-step guide on how to ~~eavesdrop~~ check if someone is online!
### 1. Download the program
Non-surprisingly, you have to download this program first to use it. Go ahead and click that green button that says "Code" and click on "Download ZIP" in the dropdown menu! If you're a nerd and you want to do it on the terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/MesonProgrammer/Online-Checker-Roblox.git`. Once that's done, you have successfully downloaded the program!
### 2. Run the program
In order to use the program, you have to run it. Run the "main.py" file and see if Python shouts at you for having uninstalled packages! If it did, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory that the local repository is in.
### 3. Use the program
Now that the program is up and running, you will probably be met with this text in your terminal:
```
Welcome to the Online Checker for Roblox!
Would you like to use the terminal or the GUI?
1. Terminal
2. GUI (WORK IN PROGRESS)
>
```
Go ahead and type [1] to use the terminal (or 2 if you're feeling special) and you will be met with this text:
```
Select users ('q' to finish)
Enter username (Users in list: 0): 
```
Here, you can type in the usernames of the people you want to ~~spy on~~ check if they are online. Once you're done, press the [q] key.<br>
Once done, you will be met with this text:
```
Enable sound? [Y/n]
```
<p style="color: rgb(255, 200, 0); font-size: 11px">TIP! The reason why 'Y' is uppercase is because it will be chosen by default i.e. if you don't choose 'n', it will chose 'Y'.</p>
If you want an apocalyptic alarm going off once someone you chose to be in the list of doom is online, press [Y] (or anything other than [N] for that matter) then hit [Enter].

### 4. Sit back and watch
Now that you have set up the alarm and all the relatively hard stuff, you can sit back, watch your terminal, and watch over your unsuspecting ~~victims~~ users that you selected. If a user decides to go online or game, an alarm will sound (if you enabled it) and your notification on your desktop and terminal will be alarm as well.

### 5. Why do this?
It's up to you, really. But the intended purpose of this program is to detect if a student is playing Roblox in class. So if you're a teacher or a curious student, this program is recommended for you!
